# I NEED TO GET A VERSION OF PROCESSING - VERSION 3.5.4 IS WHAT WORKS WITH PYTHON
# YOU PROBABLY ALREADY HAVE V3.5.4 INSTALLED FROM LAST SEMESTER
# PATH-TO: THIS IS WHERE YOU ADD YOUR OWN DIRECTORY PATH TO GET TO WHERE PROCESSING WILL BE INSTALLED/IS INSTALLED
# ONLY INSTALL IF YOU HAVEN'T ALREADY! (OR NEED THE NEW VERSION)
# IF YOU CLONE THE REPO IT WILL AUTOMATICALLY DOWNLOAD INTO A FOLDER CALLED processing-3.5.4
# CLONING IS USING GIT - WHICH WE WILL USE WITH GITHUB - IT IS LIKE TAKING A COPY OF THE REPOSITORY SIMILAR TO WHAT YOU DID WHEN YOU COPIED/CLONED MY REPO FROM CLASS
